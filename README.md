# OTP Webside 2

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### Editing the Application

You can start editing the application by modifying the `app/page.tsx` file. Changes will be reflected automatically in the browser.

### Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load the [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family by Vercel.
